## Running your own API

### Prerequisites

Steps 1 to 3 need to be taken from https://github.com/speedtracker/speedtracker#installation so you have a public Github version ready to be used to display performance data.
For configuration follow the chapters *Configuration* and *Configuration > Profiles* as described here https://speedtracker.org/docs.

Be sure to have `node` and `npm` installed.

### Installation

1. [Click here](https://www.webpagetest.org/getkey.php) to request a WebPageTest API key, if not done already.
1. Clone (or checkout) this repository in the location you want to run your API instance (`git clone git@github.com:speedtracker/speedtracker-api.git`).
1. Issue an `npm install` command at the location where you've cloned the speedtracker-api
1. Create a personal access token in your Github account (https://github.com/settings/tokens) under *Developer settings* > *Personal access tokens*
  - Be sure to check the option `public_repo`, since this is needed for the API to update and commit new performance data to your public GitHub version.
1. Be sure to have `mongodb` installed
1. Edit the main configuration file (`config.js`).
  - Define a port to run the API (default: 0, ie. 8080)
  - Paste your WebPageTest API key in the `default` field under *wpt* > *key*
  - Paste your Personal Github access token in the `default` field under *githubToken*
  - Define the mongodb database connection uri in the `default` field under *database* > *uri* (if `mongodb` was installed on localhost with default settings, the connection uri would look like this `mongodb://localhost:27017/speedtracker` whereas speedtracker would be the name of database to be created by the API)


### Run
Assuming you've done the above described installation on `localhost`, you should be able now to run your API instance.
Via a terminal go to the installation directory and issue the following command: `npm start`

With the server port you defined in the `config.js` file (ie. 8080), you should be able now to access the API via a browser: `http://localhost:8080`
If you see the following in your browser `{"success":false,"error":"INVALID_URL_OR_METHOD"}` the API is ready to be used. You'll see this message since we didn't supply the proper URL the API can work with to issue a WebPageTest.

Your API should work as described at https://speedtracker.org/docs#run, so in case of the localhost installed version the url would be
```
http://localhost:8080/v1/test/{USERNAME}/{REPOSITORY}/{BRANCH}/{PROFILE}?key={KEY}

```
